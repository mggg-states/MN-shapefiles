# Minnesota Election Shapefile
These shapefiles along with election results were created by the Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State with additional processing by MGGG staff. They replace a
previous version of this data which can still be accessed in the [Archived](https://github.com/mggg-states/MN-shapefiles/tree/master/Archived) folder of this 
repository. This updated version includes absentee/mail-in ballots as well as correction of topology errors and precinct boundary errors by the Secretary of State's office.

## Sources
These precinct shapefiles with election results were created by the Minnesota Secretary of State's Election Division and downloaded from the [Minnesota Geospatial 
Commons](https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/bdry-electionresults-2012-2020). 2010 Decennial Census demographic data were downloaded from the 
[Census API](https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1). The 2010 census block shapefile for Minnesota was downloaded from the US Census Bureau’s [TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html).

## Processing
These shapefiles came with election data already joined and precincts assigned to districts. Demographic data were aggregated from the block level to precinct
using [MGGG’s proration software](https://github.com/mggg/maup). The MN12_18 file is the 2018 precinct boundaries with election data from 2012-2016 interpolated
onto the 2018 boundaries using the `maup` package with voting age population as the weight.
